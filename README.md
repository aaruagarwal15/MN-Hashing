# MN-Hashing
Search time optimization with collision resolution using balanced tree

 In the field of networking, storing and fast lookup from the large amount of data are two important measures. 
 Hashing is one of the well-known techniques for indexing and retrieving data from the database efficiently. It 
 is mostly used for fast lookups in the fields which require quick results from the database. As the size of the 
 database increases, the number of collisions in the hash table also increases which handled through collision 
 resolution techniques. Traditional algorithms like Separate Chaining, Linear Probing, and Quadratic probing 
 takes linear search time. The tremendous increase of data in recent years requires more profound hash table 
 implementation. In this paper, we proposed a new and innovative way of implementing hash table to handle 
 collisions more efficiently in logarithmic time i.e. M-N Hashing. To handle the collisions with a scalable sized 
 hash table, the proposed algorithm used the concept of the AVL tree. The performance of the proposed algorithm is 
 analyzed using continuous integer dataset that varies from 0 to 100000. Through experiments, it is depicted that 
 M-N hashing improved the search time up to 99.97% with respect to contemporary algorithms i.e. Separate Chaining, 
 Linear Probing, and Quadratic probing.
